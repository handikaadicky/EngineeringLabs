# Engineering Labs
Engineering Labs is a place that can store and monitor your field operations team.

## Description
In civil consultant project especially in the field, there are a number of roles are working:
1. Resident Engineering (strategic)
2. Chief Inspector (field operation)
3. Inspector (support chief inspector)
4. Administrator (create reports)
5. Support team (support daily basis)

In order to finish the project, there are a number of documents that should be created:
1. Daily report by Inspector
2. Monthly, and a final report by the Administrator

Sometimes in a new project needed the documents from the previous one, but it's hard to find it because:
1. New team with no historical documents
2. Previous team won't share the reports

From that, project progress could be delayed cause of the low quality of work and got a bad sight from the project owner.
